# Data Analytics Python Challenge

As part of the USC Data Analytics Bootcamp, we are presented with a **Python Challenge** Project. This repository contains a solution to the two-part challenge.

See the [Instructions](Instructions) directory for the project instructions.


## PyBank

In this part of the challenge, we analyze a small dataset containing
data on monthly business profits. We compute total profits, the
average monthly change, and the greatest increase and decrease in
profit. Results are written to <code>stdout</code> and to a text file.


## PyPoll

We analyze a large (~72 MB, in CSV text format) election dataset. We
find the total number of votes cast, the number of votes per candidate
and their percentage of the popular vote. We identify the
winner. Results are written to <code>stdout</code> and to a text file.
